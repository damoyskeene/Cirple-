# CIRPLE 
This is my very first web project and Tailwindcss project. It took me around 1 day to complete guided by a few tutorials and the documentation 

# Rebuilding

It should run out the box, but If you would like to play around.

1. Clone repository
2. cd into the directory 
3. run the following: npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch
